**Executive Summary**

This project evaluates multiple machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent job postings using a Kaggle dataset of 17,880 listings, of which only 4.8% are labeled as fake. 

The work spans the full data‑science lifecycle — from exploratory analysis and feature engineering to model tuning and final model selection.

The dataset required substantial preprocessing due to extensive missingness, highly unstandardized categorical fields (e.g., 11,000+ unique job titles), and sparse category distributions. 

Features were engineered through standardization, parsing of location and salary fields, consolidation of rare categories, and transformation of text‑heavy fields into numerical and thematic representations.

Multiple models were trained and tuned, including logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost, with class imbalance addressed via weighting. 

Models were evaluated across alternative feature sets and probability thresholds. 

The champion model — XGBoost using detailed text‑derived features — delivered the strongest performance on the holdout test set using the default classification threshold.
